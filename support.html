          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>We wanted to share some news that the Texas Tech Men’s Volleyball Club Teams are heading to Nationals in Phoenix, Arizona this year. Last year, for the first time ever, we were able to bring not just one team, but both our A & B teams to compete at Nationals.
            We wouldn’t have made it to Nationals if it weren’t for all the generous donations last year. It would be an amazing experience to showcase our team's talent once again this upcoming spring!</p>
            <p>However, in order to achieve this goal, we are in need of anyone's assistance. With our team's hard work and dedication, the costs to attend Nationals would include the following: participation fee, lodging, and transportation.<br>
                Any amount of money is much appreciated and will help reach our goal to head to Nationals.</p><br>
            <p>Thank you!!</p>
